    <h1>ForEach() Introduction</h1>
    <p>ForEach is a method for arrays which executes a provided function once for each array element. 
    </p>
    <small><i>It explains why I got so confused looking to those arrow functions inside forEach. It's because forEach are made to execute <b>FUNCTIONS</b>. I did't know that. Good to know now ðŸ˜˜</i></small>
    <p><b>Syntax:</b> forEach(callbackFunction(currentValue, index, array))</p>
    <p>All the values passed as parameters inside de callbackFunction refer to the array values. So, the currentValue means the value of the current element the function are accessing, the index is the index of this current element and the array is the array the forEach is looping.</p>
    <p>ForEach is not the best way to loop through an array if there are exceptions. A simple loop is a best choice in this case.</p>
