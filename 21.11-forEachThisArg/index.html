    <h1>forEach using thisArg as a parameter</h1>
    <p>arr.forEach(callback(currentValue [, index [, array]])[, thisArg]);
    </p>
    <p>The optional thisArg parameter allows you to specify a value to be used as this when the callback function is called. In other words, it defines the value that will be used as context (this) within the callback function.</p>
    <p>If thisArg is provided, it will be passed as the value of this when the callback function is called during array iteration. This can be useful when you want to ensure that the callback function has a specific context, or when you need to access properties or methods of the object provided as thisArg.</p>
