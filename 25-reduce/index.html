    <h1>Reduce method</h1>
    <p>The reduce() method of Array instances executes a user-supplied "reducer" callback function on each element of the array, in order, passing in the return value from the calculation on the preceding element. The final result of running the reducer across all elements of the array is a single value.</p>

    <p>The first time that the callback is run there is no "return value of the previous calculation". If supplied, an initial value may be used in its place. Otherwise the array element at index 0 is used as the initial value and iteration starts from the next element (index 1 instead of index 0).</p>
    
    <p><i>Syntax: </i>reduce(callbackFn)</p>
    <p><i>Syntax: </i>reduce(callbackFn, initialValue)</p>
    <p><i>Syntax: </i>array.reduce(callback(accumulator, currentValue[,index[,array]])[,initialValue])</p>
    <p><strong>Pay attention: </strong><i>The 'accumulator' and 'currentValue' parameters are mandatory, so the others are optional and will only be declared if necessary.</i></p>
    <p><strong>Pay attention: </strong>By adding the 'initialValue' as a parameter of the callbackFn, this changes the functioning of the method, so that without the 'initialValue' the sequence would be: in the first iteration, index 0 of the array takes the position of accumulator and the index 1 takes the place of current value. That is, in an array with 5 items, there will be 4 iterations. However, if the 'initialValue' is declared as a parameter of the callbackFn, the array with 5 items will have 5 iterations, because the 'initialValue' takes the place of the accumulator and thus the loop rotates normally.</p>
